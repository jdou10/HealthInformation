1.1 Edit information
As a doctor, I want to edit my information in app with spreadsheet functions so that I can change information on my own device in case I have to.
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to change their own information in our system anytime they wanted to, and we need to support a editing capability for user to change information on their device. Since the spreadsheet is very common, we will add the function in for editing capability.
Constraints: not sure
Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours
Acceptance Test: Perform editing operation in user interface on demo data and save the data in the system. Show that the app can save the data correctly in the system.
